                  I can provide organizational and time management strategies to help empower and motivate you to

                  to conducting graduate research while managing external responsibilities.

                    I am adept at seeing the big picture, and the practical steps needed for you to get graduate. I can 
                    provide actionable research advice and consultation to improve your study to ensure viability and 
                    scientific integrity (this type of consultation is best done early at the proposal phase).

                    Research project mapping is helpful to stay on track, and to understand where you are in the process. 
                    Knowing what tasks are ahead allows for early preparation. For example, an IRB application can be 
                    drafted while waiting for committee member feedback on the proposal. We can also work on your 
                    professional development and presentation skills.

                  I can review the preparation of your methods section so you have a valid functioning study. Quantitative 
                  research is my expertise, and qualitative research I have some good grounding in. Early development 
                  and mapping of the proposed statistical interactions is essential. Variable identification and classification 
                  are key aspects we can explore. For your data, I can offer potential sources of secondary data, or share 
                  methods for primary data collection. I can also help with data review, variable definitions, analysis 
                  mapping, hypothesis testing, interpretation of results, and articulating the conclusions based on results 
                  generated. I can also help with the crucial step of accurately interpreting and presenting your study 
                  results for the final chapters of your thesis or dissertation.

                  Academic consultation and review of your proposal and final dissertation or thesis is helpful to ensure

                  Dissertation and thesis reviews can be conducted at different levels. A basic review can be focused on 
                  the grammar, content flow, formatting, references, and chapter completeness â€“ all needed for 
                  publication. Or a review can be focused on the scientific content including methods review, data 
                  analyses and presentation of results. Or a full review can be conducted of your proposal or completed 
                  dissertation or thesis. Editorial reviews of your proposal (Introduction, Literature Review, Methods) can 
                  help ensure the study is ready for defense and execution. Review and consultation of IRB applications 
                  can help ensure fast approval. Editorial review of your Results and Discussion sections helps ensure 
                  success for your final defense. You want to be proud of your final thesis or dissertation, and a 
                  professional editor can help sharpen the edges before publication.
