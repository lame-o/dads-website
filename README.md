# Graduate Research Coach 

Hey! This is a little side project I'm working on for my dad, who's a professor and loves helping graduate students with their research. He's got tons of experience guiding students through their academic journey, and I thought it would be cool to make his knowledge more accessible online.

## What's This All About?

This is a simple web app built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) that aims to help graduate students navigate their research journey.

## Tech Stuff (if you're into that)

Built this with Next.js because it's pretty awesome for making fast, modern websites. Plus, it makes deployment super easy. I'm using some cool features like:
- Next.js 14 with the new app router
- [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) font for that clean, modern look
- A bunch of other tools to make the experience smooth

## Questions?

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions! This is a work in progress, and I'm always looking to make it better for the students who might use it.
